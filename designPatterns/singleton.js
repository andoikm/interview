/**
 * The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one.
 * This single instance is called the singleton.
 *
 * Singletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place.
 * An example is a database connection pool.
 * The pool manages the creation, destruction,
 * and lifetime of all database connections for the entire application ensuring that no connections are 'lost'.
 *
 * Singletons reduce the need for global variables which is particularly important in JavaScript
 * because it limits namespace pollution and associated risk of name collisions.
 *
 * Several other patterns, such as, Factory, Prototype, and Fa√ßade are frequently implemented as Singletons when only one instance is needed.
